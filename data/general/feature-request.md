We use GitHub issues to track feature requests, so if you want to request a feature, please visit <https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/issues> and create a new feature request.

Before you create a new request, please search for it first, to make sure no one else requested it yet.

Please also keep in mind that we cannot add all features, so if your request is very specific to your needs, please hold back creating the request.

If you are a JavaScript developer, you can also directly contribute to Ferdi on GitHub instead! Please visit our article on ["Who is behind Ferdi?"](/general/contributors) for more information on that.
