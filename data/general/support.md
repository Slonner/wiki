### Contributing
You can support Ferdi's development by contributing to the project.

If you are a JavaScript developer, you can help us with that. If you are a designer, UI improvement ideas are always welcome and if you simply have a good idea, let us know!

If you want to contribute to Ferdi, too, take a look at <https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi> for more information about the project or <https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/issues> to find a list of bug reports and feature requests others have posted.

### Financially
Even though Ferdi can be used for free, we still have to pay bills to keep Ferdi's infratructure up and running (Servers, licenses etc.).

So if you are satisfied with Ferdi and want to give something back, please consider donating or sponsoring Ferdi at <https://opencollective.com/getferdi>.
