Yes! There are two different ways you can use your Franz account in Ferdi:

1. Import your Franz account
Simply go to <https://api.getferdi.com/import> and enter your Franz account data. We will then transfer all data from your existing Franz account and create a Ferdi account with it

2. Use Franz's servers (not recommended)
Alternatively, you can set up Ferdi to use Franz's servers instead. For this, make sure you are not yet logged into Ferdi, then choose "Change server" and enter `https://api.franzinfra.com`.

This method is **not recommended** as you will use Franz's server resources this way. Franz's creators will have to pay for the server costs without you paying for a subscription. Please import your Franz account to Ferdi instead.
