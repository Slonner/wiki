You can request a service by going to <https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/issues/new/choose> and choosing "A Recipe Request".

Please always keep in mind that we get a lot of service requests and cannot add all of them.

If you have a service that is not used by a lot of people, please use the "Custom Website" option in Ferdi instead, which allows you to load any URL. 

If you are a developer or want to dig into it, you can also always create a service integration yourself! Please take a look at <https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/blob/master/docs/integration.md> for more information about adding services yourself.
