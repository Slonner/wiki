We know that you have a lot of personal or confidential services in Ferdi, so we added Ferdi Lock to help you keep them secure.

To enable Ferdi Lock, open Ferdi's settings using the cog in the bottom left corner, scroll down and enable "Enable Password Lock". You will now have to enter a new password for the Password Lock - this does **not** have to be the same password you use for your Ferdi account.

Additionally, you can configure an inactivity lock. This way, if you havn't used Ferdi for those amount of minutes, Ferdi will lock automatically. Alternatively, you can set this to `0` to disable inactivity lock.

Ferdi will now lock when it is restarted, after you click the lock icon icon in the bottom left corner or after the inactivity lock activates.
